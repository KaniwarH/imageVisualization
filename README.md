# imageVisualization
The world is currently inundated with massive amounts of data containing critical information that can lead to knowledge. The use of visualization is a successful method for understanding and presenting the information hidden behind the data. large number of images on a website is inherently difficult to browse and access. Making summaries an important tool in rendering these collections accessible. A map-based visualization of images is beneficial method to do the data items more explorable and accessible. The goal of this thesis is to create a map-based image visualization. The nearby images have a tendency to overlap due to the zoom level. To address this issue, image clustering was considered, and the approach of selecting a single image to represent each cluster of images was used. Images are scaled according to the number of images in the underliningâ€™s cluster. The map is interactive and gives the user the opportunity to zoom in and out. Furthermore, the filtering operations are possible and details of an individual image are displayed in the pop-up window.
